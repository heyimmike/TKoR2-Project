# TKoR2-Project
My working code for Kevin Holme's Taking Kontrol approach to running an Astromech Droid.

BTW - I've titled this TKoR2 DroidWare which is Taking Kontrol of R2 DroidWare since it really doesn't have a
name yet.  The K in Kontrol is a nod to Kevin since we have this great approach to handling our droids thanks 
to him!
